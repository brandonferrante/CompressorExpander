# CompressorExpander
Compressor/Expander Audio Plugin 

Can be toggled between compressor or expander, and used as a limiter/gate via extreme ratio settings. 

This plugin served as my final project for the course Audio Signal Processing 2, which covered audio plugin development in Matlab and C++ with JUCE.
